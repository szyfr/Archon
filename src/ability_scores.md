# Ability Scores

## Scores

Ability scores in Archon are seperated into two informal types, Physical and Mental. And into three classes, Offensive, Finesse, and Defensive.

Offensive ability scores are used in aggressive actions taken by an individual, attempting a grapple, making a charm person check, etc. Defensive scores are used in defensive actions, such as resisting the aformentioned actions. Finesse scores can be used in certain situations to replace either Offensive or Defensive score, or as an alternative.

### Physical

#### Strength (STR)

The physical power of an individual. Used during Offensive actions taken, such as Hand-to-hand combat, attempting to grapple an individual, etc.

**Carry weight** is determined by 10 times an individual's strength score in kilograms. When an individual is over their carry limit their land / burrow speeds are halved, they lose any swim / fly speeds they may have, and during combat can only take either a move action or a standard action.
